title : IL == MSIL == CIL

In the .NET world IL, MSIL, and CIL all refer to the compiled output of .NET languages. 

* IL - Intermediate Language
* MSIL - Microsoft Intermediate Language
* CIL - Common Intermediate Language

In most cases CIL is the best nomenclature to use of the three. This is because IL can have other meanings in other contexts [1][1], and MSIL isn't mentioned in the standards [2][2].

As a side note CIL isn't able to be executed directly. Instead it relies on a second compiler to turn it into proper assembly code for the machine it is running on. There are currently three main CIL to Assembly compilers: Microsoft's CLR (aka JIT), Microsoft's NGEN pre-compiler and Xamarin's Mono project (also a JIT).
