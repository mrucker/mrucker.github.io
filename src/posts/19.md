# Definition Of Information #
+ Information - an observation or a record of an observation

Reality, itself, is not information. However, an observation of reality is. This means, if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, then it doesn't create any information. On the other side, ideas are always information. They are, by definition, observations of ones thoughts.

# Meaning of Information #
 + Meaningful - Both information and a subject it describes
 + Meaningless - Either information or a subject -- not both

For example, let's say we have the information "five years". Without knowing the subject it modifies "five years" says nothing. But, if we add the subject Bobby, and say Bobby is five years old, then "five years" becomes meaningful.

# Sources Of Information: #
 + Experiencing - What our senses feel. (E.g., I see the sky is cloudy.)
 + Interpreting - What our senses mean. (E.g., I should expect rain.)

These sources highlight a unique aspect of humanity. We are always, in every moment, both experiencing and interpreting reality. For example, if I hit a traffic light while driving to work, I experience having to stop, and I likely interpret it as an nuisance.

# Types Of Information: #
 + Historical   - Information concerning completed events in the past
 + Predictive   - Information about what an individual thinks may happen
 + Qualitative  - Information about an event using fuzzy measurements
 + Quantitative - Information about an event using clear measurements
